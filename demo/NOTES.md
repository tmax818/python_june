# Python Notes

## What is a code block?
 - A code block is a set of lines of code that belong together

 - javascript code block:

```javascript
for(let i = 0; i < 10; i++){
    console.log(i)
}
console.log("hello world")
```

- code block in Python:

```python
for i in range(10):
    print(i)
print('Hello world')
```
