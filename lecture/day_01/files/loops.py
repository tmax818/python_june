# Flexible Counter - Set three variables: lowNum, highNum, mult. Starting at lowNum and going through highNum, print only the integers that are a multiple of mult. For example, if lowNum=2, highNum=9, and mult=3, the loop should print 3, 6, 9 (on successive lines)

lowNum = 2
highNum = 9
mult = 3

for i in range(lowNum,highNum + 1):
    if(i % mult == 0):
        print(i)
